                    Magni Devi and Pukrdi Devi are inseparable. Together they are even unafraid of taking on the government to help their community. These women live in the village of Badai in the district of Kangra where it was once unacceptable for women to step out of their homes. However, now Magni Devi and Pukrdi Devi travel far distances to many different Mahila Mandals (Village Women’s Groups) and give advice to the Pradhans (presidents) on how to mobilize their community. They are a source of inspiration and smiles for other rural women. <a href="cord1.html" rel="modal:open" class="readMore">Read more</a></div>

                    Educating children at a young age allows them to develop skills that are necessary for them to contribute to society. However, children in rural communities are often needed to work and earn money. Also, discrimination often keeps young girls at home where they help their mothers care for their younger siblings. This keeps them from attending school and obtaining a proper education. An essential part of this education begins at the age of two when children’s minds are very impressionable. However, a child’s pre-school education is neglected because parents are busy trying to earn enough money. As a result, children often accompany their mothers while they work, or they are looked after by neighbors or older relatives. They miss out on a Balwadi (Pre-School) education which teaches children basic skills, allows them to interact with other children, and stimulates their minds. <a href="cord2.html" rel="modal:open" class="readMore">Read more</a>

                     “One roti (circular bread) on top of another roti makes an 8” says Durga, CORD’s Literacy program teacher. The methods used to teach rural women how to read and write are very simple. With the shape of a roti and a stick, Durga is able to teach women numbers, letters, words, and how to sign their names. Most of the women who attend literacy classes are over the age of 40; these women grew up during a time when education was not emphasized for females. Although their family members tell them they are too old to learn how to read and write, they pay no attention and continue to come to CORD each week for class. Like the women, Durga has received very little education and has only completed the fifth standard. However, she still strongly believes that women can learn at any age even with little or no formal schooling. Each woman who attends the class has a different reason for becoming literate. <a href="cord3.html" rel="modal:open" class="readMore">Read more</a>
