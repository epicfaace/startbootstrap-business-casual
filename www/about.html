                    <li>CORD USA (Chinmaya Organization for Rehabilitation & Development) is a secular, non-profit that aims to help communities create a sustainable program to aid in their holistic welfare. CORD USA serves humanity regardless of race, religion, color, gender or nationality. CORD USA works closely with local communities as well as CORD in India to fulfill its mission.</li>

                    <li>CORD USA has built a sustainable and replicable model by focusing on development (teaching people to earn a living) as opposed to welfare (e.g. donating food)</li><li>
 
                    The key success factor of CORD USA is their motto of Active Participation. The villager has to be willing to take the first step to transform his/her life and CORD USA will take 5 steps forward to assist the person.</li><li>
 
                    Belief in one's ability to motivate another to change life-long thinking patterns and habits. CORDUSA enables the poor to transform their lives through programs driven by themselves on the simple premise that inspiration from within brings out the best in everyone. Thatâ€™s what makes the program successful!</li>
 <li>
We strive to facilitate integrated, sustainable social help programs in local communities and in the Indian subcontinent through processes of self-empowerment and enrichment.  </li>
